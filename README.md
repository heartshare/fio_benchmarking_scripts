# fio_benchmarking_scripts

Shell script to perform automatic bench-marking and reporting. This script takes different values of block size, data set size, read/write percentage and number of threads per run as input from file and performs fio tests and prepares a csv report of read/write IOPS and read/write bandwidth reported per run. This could be exported for analysis for storage architecting and design considerations.
